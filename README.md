# Bamazon

Bamazon is a Command Line Interface application that takes input from customers, managers and supervisors. The app is connected to a relational database, which contains a products and a departments table. The customer can purchase a requested amount of items if there is stock availability for that particular product. The manager can view a table of all available products, low stock products, add inventory to existing products and add new products to the store. The supervisor can view store departments with aggregated sales and profit data and can add new departments to the database.

The app uses npm mysql, inquirer and table packages.
